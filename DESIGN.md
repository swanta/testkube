# Testkube Design Guidelines & Resources

A collection of design contribution guidelines and resources for Testkube.

> **All participating designers are highly encouraged to shape and evolve these guidelines!**

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

We're glad you're looking to contribute ideas and design efforts to Testkube!

Testkube is the Kubernetes-native testing framework for testers and developers. We aim to simplify Tester's life by decoupling testing from CI/CD for improved test execution pipelines and faster runtimes.

Testkube consists of 3 different parts. 
1. The API
2. The CLI
3. The Frontend Application

**You can always try our latest version live over here: https://demo.testkube.io**

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute design

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/issues) here on GitHub (we tend to label them with `ðŸš¨ needs-ux`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `idea ðŸ’¡` label for it.
3. Clone the public Figma files or create new ones and share them publicly
4. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions around it

**We encourage you to:**

- Get in touch with the team by starting a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/issues) or on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hfq44wtR6Q).
- Check out our [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
  [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## ðŸŽ­ Target audience

Since we are creating a product for Testers and Developers our target audience is pretty straight forward. Sometimes wo do also like to include DevOps people into our considerations.

## ðŸ’… Design relevant materials

We currently aim to to build a more comprehensive Design System which will also include some guidance on Component usage, Wording, and patterns. 

For now â€“ here is a list of design relevant information and materials:


### Fonts & Colors

Fonts and Color Palettes can be found as design tokens and predefined styles in the Figma files listed below.


### Design Files, Screenshots, etc

Our main Design file including all tokens can be found here:
