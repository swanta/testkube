# Testkube Test and Test Suite Scheduling

In order to run Tests and Test Suites on a regular basis, we support a scheduling mechanism for these objects.
CRDs both for test and test suite contain a **schedule** field used to define rules for launching them in time.
Testkube's schedule data format is the same that is used to define Kubernetes Cron jobs (check Wikipedia Cron format for details <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>).

## **Scheduling Architecture**

Testkube uses the scheduling engine from Kubernetes Cron jobs.
In fact, for each scheduled Test or Test Suite, a special cron job is created from this template:
<https://github.com/kubeshop/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/testkube-api/cronjob-template.yml>.
Technically, it is a callback to Testkube API server method launching either Test or Test Suite execution.
This works similarly to scheduled Test and Test Suite executions done by external scheduling platforms. 

## **Create a Test with a Schedule**

Let's create a test with a required schedule using Testkube CLI command:

```bash
kubectl testkube create test --file test/postman/TODO.postman_collection.json --name scheduled-test --schedule="*/1 * * * *"
```

Output:

```bash
Detected test type postman/collection
Test created  / scheduled-test ðŸ¥‡
```

We successfully created a scheduled test and can check a list of the available tests:

```bash
kubectl testkube get tests
```

Output:

```bash
  NAME              | TYPE               | CREATED                       | LABELS | SCHEDULE    | STATUS | EXECUTION ID              
+-------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------+--------+-------------+--------+--------------------------+
  scheduled-test    | postman/collection | 2022-04-13 12:37:40 +0000 UTC |        | */1 * * * * |        |                           
```

The scheduled test was created and successfully scheduled for execution.
Let's check a Cron job connected to this test.

```bash
kubectl get cronjobs -A
```

Output:

```bash
NAMESPACE   NAME                   SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
testkube    scheduled-test-tests   */1 * * * *   False     1        42s           3m22s
```

The Cron job for this test was successfully created and the test was executed.
To the check Cron job details:

```bash
kubectl describe cronjob scheduled-test-tests -n testkube
```

Output:

```bash

```

As mentioned above, we have a scheduled callback for launching our test.

## **Getting Scheduled Test Results**

Now we can check whether the test is executed every minute for the schedule we provided.

```bash
kubectl testkube get execution
```

Output:

```bash
  ID                       | NAME                | TYPE               | STATUS  | LABELS  
+--------------------------+---------------------+--------------------+---------+--------+
  6256c98f418062706814e1fc | scheduled-test      | postman/collection | passed  |         
  6256c953418062706814e1fa | scheduled-test      | postman/collection | passed  |         
  6256c91e418062706814e1f8 | scheduled-test      | postman/collection | passed  |         
  6256c8db418062706814e1f6 | scheduled-test      | postman/collection | passed  |         
  6256c89f418062706814e1f4 | scheduled-test      | postman/collection | passed  |         
  6256c885418062706814e1f2 | scheduled-test      | postman/collection | passed  |         
  6256c87e418062706814e1f0 | scheduled-test      | postman/collection | passed  | 
```

The test is successfully regularly executed.

## **Create a Test Suite with a Schedule**

Let's create a Test Suite with a required schedule using the Testkube CLI command:

```bash
cat test/suites/testsuite.json | kubectl testkube create testsuite --name scheduled-testsuite --schedule="*/1 * * * *"
```

Output:

```bash
TestSuite created scheduled-testsuite ðŸ¥‡
```

We successfully created a scheduled Test Suite and can view a list of the available Test Suites:

```bash
kubectl testkube get testsuites
```

Output:

```bash
  NAME                | DESCRIPTION            | STEPS | LABELS | SCHEDULE    | STATUS | EXECUTION ID  
+---------------------+------------------------+-------+--------+-------------+--------+--------------+
  scheduled-testsuite | Run test several times |     2 |        | */1 * * * * |        |    
```

The scheduled test suite was created and successfully scheduled for execution.
We will skip the Cron job details, they are fully similar to test one described above.

## **Getting Scheduled Test Suite Results**

The Test Suite is executed every minute for the schedule we provided.

```bash
kubectl testkube get tse
```

Output:

```bash
  ID                       | TEST SUITE NAME     | EXECUTION NAME                             | STATUS | STEPS | LABELS  
+--------------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------+--------+-------+--------+
  6256ce3f418062706814e210 | scheduled-testsuite | scheduled-testsuite.abnormally-in-lark     | passed |     2 |
  6256ce04418062706814e20c | scheduled-testsuite | scheduled-testsuite.kindly-evolved-primate | passed |     2 |
  6256cdcc418062706814e208 | scheduled-testsuite | scheduled-testsuite.formerly-champion-dodo | passed |     2 |
```

The Test Suite is successfully executed according to the schedule set.
